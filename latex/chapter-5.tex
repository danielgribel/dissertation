\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}

-- Review 1: About the problem and the model-oriented approach to solve clustering.
In this dissertation the MSSC problem was ...

-- Review 2: About the method (meta-heuristic).
In this work a meta-heuristic was proposed to solve the MSSC problem ...

-- Crossover + Mutation: The importance of the proposed crossover + mutation as a novelty in clustering. The role of mutation in diversification

-- Results (cost): The proposed method outperformed the best current literature results for all considered sets of benchmark instances in terms of solution quality for MSSC

-- Results (time): In terms of time, the proposed method outperformed some state-of-the-art algorithms in large instances

-- The proposed meta-heuristic is easy to understand and implement

-- Future work: Solve different objectives in clustering. As we tackle the clustering problem from an optimization perspective through a meta-heuristic, we can elaborate a neighbourhood structure that is general enough to deal with different models
